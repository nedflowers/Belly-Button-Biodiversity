# Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
Microbiologists at Improbable Foods are researching avenues to synthesize bacteria into lab-grown “meat”.  They hypothesize the most useful bacteria is in the human navel.  To prove their hypothesis, they’ve enlisted multiple anonymous participants, each assigned a unique ID.  In this repository, we create a web-based dashboard to visualize the top 10 bacterial species living on each participant. The dashboard will include a drop-down that selects an induvial ID and populates each table and graph with the matching dataset.
